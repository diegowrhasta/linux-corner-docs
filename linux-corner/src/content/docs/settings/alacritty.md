title: Alacritty Settings
description: Layout on how I configure Alacritty on my machine
---

A simple explanation (refresher) as to the decisions when configuring alacritty on 
my own machine. Alacritty is an open-source GPU-accelerated terminal emulator.

## Why Alacritty?

My motto when it comes to workflows (this goes beyond just software dev) is that 
we should always iterate on what we do [every day](https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-journey-mastery-Anniversary/dp/0135957052/131-7918119-3010347?psc=1), 
and under this presumption, I realized that thinks that come from the Linux community, 
developers and ideologies really vibe with me in the sense of **being fast**, **concise**, 
and **practical**.

Alacritty is [open source](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty), meaning that it 
is bound to have tons of ideas applied to it, for the sake of _making it fun_. 
With this as a basis, based on its record of **well-behaved** and **reasonal** 
community building, I picked it due to its sheer speed (thanks to the fact that 
you get to compile it for your machine specifically), and overall adherence to 
common linux practices (that are somewhat of the basis of modern DevOps and overall 
software in general).

## Hacking for the vibes

One thing that I did come across here is the fact that Alacritty has not a _"background 
image"_ type of function. But by being a **bit clever** I managed to achieve what I 
wanted. You just have to make Alacritty transparent and reduce opacity 
a bit (more on that in the settings section).

## Settings rundown

```toml
[terminal]
shell = { program = "/usr/bin/tmux", args = ["new-session", "-A", "-s", "main"] }

[window]
opacity = 0.8

[keyboard]
bindings = [
  # New "tab"
  { key = "T", mods = "Control|Shift", chars = "\u0002\u0014" },

  # Navigate tabs
  { key = "Left", mods = "Control|Shift", command = { program = "/usr/bin/tmux", args = ["previous-window"] } },
  { key = "Right", mods = "Control|Shift", command = { program = "/usr/bin/tmux", args = ["next-window"] } },

  # Jump to tab N
  { key = "Key1", mods = "Control|Alt", command = { program = "/usr/bin/tmux", args = ["select-window", "-t", "0"] } },
  { key = "Key2", mods = "Control|Alt", command = { program = "/usr/bin/tmux", args = ["select-window", "-t", "1"] } },
  { key = "Key3", mods = "Control|Alt", command = { program = "/usr/bin/tmux", args = ["select-window", "-t", "2"] } },
  { key = "Key4", mods = "Control|Alt", command = { program = "/usr/bin/tmux", args = ["select-window", "-t", "3"] } },
  # ... add 3â€“9 if you want more
]

```

In short:

**Terminal**

- We are relegating all the terminal work to `tmux`. Alacritty simply displays it.
- We open the tmux session as a _new session_. However, if it finds a previous session 
it will attach to it (effectively making so that we can open up things **where we 
left off**)
- The name of the session for attaching and for creation will be `main`

**Window**

- By setting the opacity of Alacritty to `0.8` we allow for the background to show, 
and in my specific setup (after you set a nice wallpaper like the one on the repo) 
it will give the idea that the terminal has a background.

**Keyboard**

- Specific hotkeys so that I can move between different windows all managed by 
`tmux`. We create new _"tabs"_ with `Ctrl + T`. There's a bit to say as to how this 
setup actually makes everything work, so please read in regards to the [bridge.](#the-alacritty-and-tmux-bridge)
- We can navigate from left to right between tabs with `Ctrl + Shift + <Arrow>`.
- We can jump directly to specific tabs by their order with `Ctrl + Alt + <Number>`.

## The alacritty and tmux bridge

The way that I chose to sort of establish **new key bindings** that in turn might leverage 
some function in tmux was to literally catch the **key combinations** at the `alacritty` 
level and then forward something else to `tmux`.

### A short example

We'll take the _new window_ key binding in `alacritty.toml` as an illustrative 
example:

```
  { key = "T", mods = "Control|Shift", chars = "\u0002\u0014" },
```

In this instance to the combination of `Ctrl + Shift + t` we are then making 
`alacritty` forward some specific bytes to the terminal (tmux). In this instance:

- `\u0002` translates to `Ctrl + b` which is tmux's default prefix for possible 
extra extended hotkeys.
- `\u0014` translates t0 `Ctrl + t` which is actually the specific binding on tmux's 
side that will trigger its `new-window` function with an extra parameter that will 
allow for the new session to open up on the active session's path.

As you can see, it's a small system in which **Alacritty** captures _combinations_, 
and then forwards a much [simpler signal](/settings/tmux) to **tmux** so that it grabs it and runs 
something on its side. This is the anatomy of how we should configure things and 
how everything else will be made.

**_Small big note:_** Some sources might treat the `chars` as `x02` or `x04`, but 
for my specific instance, `alacritty` didn't recognize the characters so I'm using the 
translated equivalents in **unicode**.

### A small tip

Alacritty by default _should_ detect changes in its `.toml` config the moment you 
save the file. So the moment you want to test something out it should be applied 
automatically, in case of errors as well it will show a red screen and will fallback 
to a _no settings_ state.
