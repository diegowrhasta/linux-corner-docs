## Motivations

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Share the knowledge" icon="open-book">
		I want to share as much knowledge as I can with the world.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Document my journey" icon="puzzle">
		We always tend to forget in tech (due to complexity), so this is also a personal log for refreshing my memory. You can see 
    my configs at <a href="https://github.com/diegowrhasta/dotfiles?tab=readme-ov-file" target="_blank">dotfiles repo</a>
	</Card>
	<Card title="Have fun exploring" icon="starlight">
		I am an advocate for documentation frameworks (really like Antora Docs), so I wanted to try Starlight, since it's powered by Astro.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Keep my skills sharp" icon="seti:css">
		Going all in and making this from zero, open source, have an automated CI/CD pipeline deploying to a custom domain. It's all just part of not forgetting what I know.
	</Card>
