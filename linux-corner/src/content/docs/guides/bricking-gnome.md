title: What if you bricked GNOME?
description: Happened to me once I tried to switch package manager mirrors

If you willy-nillingly switch _repository mirrors_ and upgrade your system and 
then go back to another one. You might run into issues that brick the whole 
**GNOME Desktop Environment**.

## The symptom

It was that after I had changed my mirrors for the package manager to another one 
since it was returning tons of **connection errors** I realized that GNOME _had died_.

A screen with `Oops an Error Occured Please contact a system manager` was my only 
friend.

Luckily, the DE is only _one_ way to use the computer. On **Linux** you can press 
something like `Ctrl + 4` and this will default to the `terminal`. In here you can 
login with a user and a password (_be sure to remember these, I know I forgot about 
them). It's in here that you can start trying things out by re-installing the whole 
**GNOME DE** or trying to troubleshoot what went wrong.
