title: Japanese Keyboard on Linux
description: A guide on how to setup a Japanese keyboard on Gnome (Wayland)

Since I am an avid _weeb_, and also reside in the originating country of this language 
I need a Japanese keyboard, even though you might **buy** a japanese keyboard, believe 
me, it's better (at least in Linux) to make do with a bit of **software emulation**.

## Preamble

Credit where credit is due, this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJoXhS4EUJs) helped me a lot, luckily it was on 
Arch, other things such as Manjaro-GNOME specific centric things I figured them 
out on my own.
