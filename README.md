# Introduction

You can access the site at [Linux Corner](https://linux-corner.dsbalderrama.top).

This is an open source project powered by Astro's [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/).
a combination of simply wanting to use it for something and taking the time to
get a site up and running in order to publish interesting problems in Linux, or
ways of automating tasks, a corner relegated to Linux topics.

## Motivation

This site is up for grabs for anyone, knowledge should be shared and insight should
be discussed as much as we can. Hence this is a testament to the FOSS mindset plus
a personal attempt at providing to the internet and the world with already distilled
data across different topics for Linux. (Specifically Manjaro with Gnome since that's
what I run on my personal computer).

_This is also a personal site so that I don't lose this information in the future
when I eventually forget on how to do something._

## Final Words

Feel free to provide to the site! This is Open Source truthfully!
